Design thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation. It involves understanding the needs of people, re-framing problems, and generating creative solutions. Unlike traditional problem-solving methods, design thinking encourages a deep empathy for users and a willingness to experiment with new ideas. The six key stages of design thinking are: Empathise: Understand the people you're designing for. Define: Clearly articulate the problem. Ideate: Generate a wide array of possible solutions. Prototype: Build a tangible representation of one or more ideas. Test: Test the prototypes with users and refine them based on feedback. Implement: Roll out the refined solution to the market or integrate it into the operational workflow. Watch: The Design Thinking Process Estimated Video Length: 4 minutes Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n    \n    TRANSCRIPT:\n    ------------------------------------------------------------\n    Design Thinking is a five-step process to come up with meaningful ideas that solve real problems for a particular group of people. The process is taught in top design and business schools around the world. It has brought many businesses lots of happy customers and helped entrepreneurs from all around the world to solve problems with innovative new solutions. Step 1. Empathise The purpose of Step 1 is to conduct interviews that give you an idea about what people really care about. We need to empathise with their situation. For example, if you want to help old people, you might find that they want to keep the ability to walk around. In your conversations, they might share with you different ways they can do that. Later into the interview, you'll want to dig a little deeper, look for personal stories or situations where things became difficult. Ideally, you redo the process with many people with the same problem. Step 2. Define the problem Looking at the interviews, you can now understand the actual needs that people are trying to fulfil with certain activities. One way to do that is to underline the verbs or activities that the people mentioned when talking about their problems, like going for a walk, meeting old friends for tea, or simply going grocery shopping around the corner store. You might realise it's not so much about going out, but more about staying in touch. After your analysis, formulate a problem statement. Some elderly are afraid to be lonely, they want to stay connected. Step 3. Ideate Now focus only on the problem statement and come up with ideas that solve the problem. The point is not to get a perfect idea, but rather to come up with many ideas, like unique virtual reality experiences, senior friendly hoverboards or a modified push cart. Whatever it is, sketch up your best ideas and show them to the people you are trying to help, so you can get their feedback. Step 4. Prototype Now take a moment to reflect on what you have learned from your conversations about the different ideas. Ask yourself, how does your idea fit in the context of people's actual lives? Your solution could be a combination of a new idea and what is already being used. Then connect the dots, sketch up your final solution and go build a real prototype that's just good enough to be tested. Step 5. Test Now test your prototype with actual users. Don't defend your idea in case people don't like it. The point is to learn what works and what didn't, so any feedback is great. Then go back to ideation or prototyping and apply your learning. Repeat the process until you have a prototype that works and solves the real problem. Now you are ready to change the world or open shop.

To truly empathise, start by immersing yourself in their environment. Conduct interviews, observe their interactions, and engage in their daily activities. Use techniques like empathy maps and user journey maps to organise and visualise the insights you gather. For example, if you're designing a new feature for a mobile app, spend time observing how users interact with similar apps. Ask open-ended questions to uncover their pain points and needs. By defining problems from their perspective, you shift from making assumptions to addressing real user concerns. This user-centric approach ensures that the solutions you develop are relevant and impactful. Building Your Empathy Toolkit: Interviews: Engage with users by asking open-ended questions to get deeper insights. Observation: Spend time watching users as they interact with products or services in their natural environment. Shadowing: Follow users to gain first-hand experience of their day-to-day interactions and challenges. Empathy ensures that the solutions you create are rooted in a genuine understanding of your users' needs and will lead to more innovative and impactful outcomes. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n    ",

Ideation is about thinking broadly and without judgment to explore all possibilities. The goal is to foster creativity and unlock new ideas that might not have been obvious at the start. Brainstorming for Innovation: Brainstorming is one of the most common ideation techniques. It encourages a free flow of ideas within a diverse group. The key to a successful brainstorming session is creating a safe space where participants can share their ideas without fear of criticism. This is important for nurturing wild ideas that can lead to groundbreaking innovations. Other Effective Ideation Techniques: SCAMPER: This method encourages you to think about an existing idea and how it can be modified using the acronym SCAMPER: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. This structured approach helps you explore different perspectives. Mind Mapping: A visual tool that starts with a central idea and branches out into various sub-ideas, enabling you to explore the relationships between concepts and discover hidden connections. Crazy 8s: A rapid sketching technique where participants draw eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. This fast-paced exercise pushes creative boundaries and challenges conventional thinking. From Ideas to Prototypes After gathering a wealth of ideas, it's time to narrow them down to the most promising solutions. Prioritize ideas based on feasibility, impact, and user needs. For instance, if you're redesigning a website, use these techniques to come up with innovative features or enhancements that could improve user experience. By employing a variety of ideation methods, you’ll ensure a wide range of potential solutions. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n    ",

This stage is where creativity meets practicality as you begin to build a representation of your solution. Prototypes can be low-fidelity (simple sketches) or high-fidelity (interactive digital models), depending on the stage of development. Types of Prototypes: Low-Fidelity Prototypes: These are quick, low-cost representations of your idea, such as hand-drawn sketches or paper models. They allow you to test ideas without investing significant time or resources. For example, you might sketch a new workflow for project management on a whiteboard to see how users respond to it. High-Fidelity Prototypes: These are more polished and interactive models created using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. They simulate the user experience more closely and are useful when you need detailed feedback on specific interactions. How to effectively prototype and test your ideas: Create Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Start with simple sketches or wireframes. These are quick and inexpensive ways to visualise concepts and gather initial feedback. Build Interactive Models: Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to create clickable prototypes that simulate user interactions. Conduct Usability Testing: Present your prototypes to real users and observe their interactions. Gather feedback on what works well and what needs improvement. For example, if you’re designing a new user interface, build a clickable prototype and test it with a small group of users. Their feedback will guide you in refining the design before investing in a more polished version. Testing with Real Users Prototypes are only as good as the feedback they generate. Once you’ve built a prototype, test it with real users to see how they interact with it. Pay close attention to areas where users encounter difficulties or confusion. Usability testing can reveal invaluable insights that will guide you in refining your solution. Testing should be an iterative process where you repeatedly refine the prototype based on feedback until the design meets user needs effectively. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n    ",

Watch the video, then complete this non-graded survey to test your knowledge of plagiarism: Self-check: Plagiarism Netiquette, or Why Is It Harder to Be Polite Online? Netiquette refers to using common courtesy in online communication. All members of the class are expected to follow netiquette in all course communications. Use these guidelines: Use capital letters sparingly. THEY LOOK LIKE SHOUTING. Forward emails only with a writer's permission. Be considerate of others' feelings and use language carefully. Cite all quotations, references, and sources (otherwise, it is plagiarism). Use humor carefully. It is hard to \"read\" tone; sometimes, humor can be misread as criticism or personal attack. Feel free to use emoticons, such as :) for a smiley face, to let others know you are being humorous. Use complete sentences and standard English grammar to compose posts. Write in proper paragraphs. Review work before submitting it. Text speak, such as \"ur\" for \"your\" or \"ru\" for \"are you\" etc., is only acceptable when texting.

But what is it exactly? According to the Oxford Dictionary, plagiarism is the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own. Let's say you're writing something for the company newsletter, and you find a great article online that's full of useful information. So you take several parts of that article, change a few words around, and submit it without giving credit to the original author. That's plagiarism, and it can lead to serious consequences. In school, taking credit for someone else's work could mean you fail an assignment or class or face disciplinary action. In the workplace, it could result in damage to your reputation, legal repercussions, or even losing your job. Even if you accidentally do it, such as forgetting to cite a source or a misquoting someone, it can quickly get you in trouble. Luckily, we know a few strategies that will help you avoid plagiarism. First, always cite your sources. Showing where you found your information gives credit to the original authors and helps reinforce the legitimacy of your content. If you're quoting from a source, always quote the sources exact words. When inserting one into your work, place quotation marks around it, and be sure to include the author's name in the same sentence. When you want to discuss information from a source without quoting it directly, it's important you rewrite that information in your own words. Along with citing the source, use different language and sentence structures, and explore the sources ideas from your own perspective. This strategy can help you say something new, original, and plagiarism free. plagiarism can seem like an easy shortcut that'll save you time and effort, but it will only hurt you in a long run. Be clear and upfront about where you get your information, and you'll be free to create original content you can be proud of.

Psychologists deal with important problems about how the human mind works and why. The following video clip explains just one fascinating phenomenon called the McGurk Effect. Video: Try This Bizarre Illusion Did you find yourself hearing the wrong sound when the picture changed? I must confess, I found myself drawn into the illusion! While it may appear trivial at first glance, this phenomenon sheds light on the remarkable intricacies of our minds, merely scratching the surface of their complexity. It's precisely these captivating puzzles that drive psychologists to delve deeper into understanding human cognition and behavior. Throughout this introductory course in psychology, we'll embark on a journey to explore various concepts and theories. As we progress through objectives and activities, I encourage you to draw connections between your own life experiences—things you've observed, heard, or directly encountered—and the research, findings, and theories we'll be exploring together. Select 'Next' to continue ⬇︎\n    \n    TRANSCRIPT:\n    ------------------------------------------------------------\n    At any one moment, we are being bombarded by sensory information. Our brains do a remarkable job of making sensor video. It seems easy enough to separate the sounds we hear from the sites we see. But there is one illusion that reveals this isn't always the case. Have a look at this. What do you hear? But look what happens when we change the picture. And yet, the sound hasn't changed. In every clip you are only ever hearing bar with a B. It's an illusion known as the McGurk effect. Take another look. Concentrate first on the right of the screen. Now to the left of the screen. The illusion occurs because what you are seeing clashes with what you are hearing. In the illusion, what we see overrides what we hear. So the mouth movements we see as we look at a face can actually influence what we believe we are hearing. If we close our eyes, we actually hear the sound as it is. If we open our eyes, we actually see how the mouth movements can influence what we are hearing. It's a bizarre effect. Remember, the only sound you are hearing is bar with a B. What's remarkable about this illusion is even knowing how it's done doesn't seem to make a difference. The effect works no matter how much you know about the effect. I've been studying the McGurk effect for 25 years now. And I've been the face in the stimuli. I've seen stimuli thousands and thousands of times. But the effect still works on me. I can't help it. The speech brain just takes in that information and doesn't care about what outside knowledge you bring to bear. The McGurk effect shows us that what we hear may not always be the truth. But it also helps us to understand what happens when our senses conflict. When the brain has the conflicting information, it tries to make sense of that conflict. And depending on what type of modality is providing more, I guess, selling into information, that information might override or at least combine with the other information. So we can't always trust what we hear, because sometimes our sense of vision takes over, enabling us to maintain a coherent view of the world.\n    ------------------------------------------------------------\n    ",

Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. The word “psychology” comes from the Greek words “psyche,” meaning life, and “logos,” meaning explanation. Psychology is a popular major for students, a popular topic in the public media, and a part of our everyday lives. Television shows such as Dr. Phil feature psychologists who provide personal advice to those with personal or family difficulties. Crime dramas such as CSI, Lie to Me, and others feature the work of forensic psychologists who use psychological principles to help solve crimes. And many people have direct knowledge about psychology because they have visited psychologists, for instance, school counselors, family therapists, and religious, marriage, or bereavement counselors. Because we are frequently exposed to the work of psychologists in our everyday lives, we all have an idea about what psychology is and what psychologists do. In many ways I am sure that your conceptions are correct. Psychologists do work in forensic fields, and they do provide counseling and therapy for people in distress. But there are hundreds of thousands of psychologists in the world, and most of them work in other places, doing work that you are probably not aware of. What Next? This lesson provides an introduction to the broad field of psychology and the many approaches that psychologists take to understanding human behavior. We will consider how psychologists conduct scientific research, with an overview of some of the most important approaches used and topics studied by psychologists, and also consider the variety of fields in which psychologists work and the careers that are available to people with psychology degrees. I expect that you may find that at least some of your preconceptions about psychology will be challenged and changed, and you will learn that psychology is a field that will provide you with new ways of thinking about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions.

The little cogs of your consciousness cranking away, making your life possible, making society function all of the things that you're so glad you can do, and all the ones you wish you could stop doing. Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans currently know about. The rules that govern it are mysterious and elusive. Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough to understand themselves, but that's not gonna stop us from trying. The word psychology comes from the Latin for the study of the soul, and while its formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term psychology wasn't coined until around the turn of the 16th century, and a practice that we would actually call science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head, being as we have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. 2000 years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams requiring public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian Dr. Muhammad Ibn Zakaria Al-Razi, also known as Razi's, was one of the first to describe mental illness and even treated patients in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions. How can humans do horrible things like commit genocide and torture other humans and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will or are we simply driven by our environment, biology and non-conscious influences? What is mental illness and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself am I still human? I don't know! What over the next six months? These are the questions that we're going to be exploring together. How are brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed? Why we behave the way we do even when we don't want to? And what it means to be thinking and feeling and alive? When hearing the word psychology, most people probably think of a therapist listening to a patient unpacking the details of his day while reclining on a gouge. Maybe that therapist is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking his whisk or gin, admit it. If you're thinking about psychology, you're probably picturing Freud. Segment Freud was one of the most tremendously influential and controversial thinkers of his time, maybe of all time. His theories help build our views on childhood, personality, dreams and sexuality and his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. His life was long and spend an important swath of history from the American Civil War to World War II. But like most great scientists Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by building on the work of others. And of course innovation in the field didn't stop with him. In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly diverse sciences in terms of the questions it proposes, the methods it applies, and the different schools of thought and disciplines it contains. Perhaps more than any other science psychology is just a big ol' integrated melting pot. For instance, right around Freud's time, there were a lot of different schools thought about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis. Scientific psychology got its start in 1879 in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set up the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leapsig just a few years after publishing his principles of physiological psychology, considered the first true psychology textbook. Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchner took cues from chemists and physicists and argued that if those people could break down all matter into simple elements or structures, why couldn't they do the same for the brain? They tried to understand the structures of consciousness by getting patients to look inward, asking them how they felt when they watched a sunset, they're smelled a coffee or licked a kitten or whatever. Titchner named this approach structuralism, but despite its rigid sounding name, it really relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you make sense and feel something different than I do even if we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of course, can't actually observe a patient's inner thoughts or feeling so ultimately the structuralist school of thought is fairly short lived. By contrast, American physician and philosopher William James proposed a different set of questions focusing on why we think and feel and smell and lick whatever. Basically, he focused on the function of behavior. This approach, functionalism, was inspired by Charles Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. James published his seminal book The Principles of Psychology in 1890, defining psychology as the science of mental life. Just as Freud was starting to flex his big brain. Sigmund Freud began his medical career at a V&E's hospital, but in 1886, he started his own practice specializing in nervous disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed his colleague, Yosef Breuer, treat a patient called Anna O, with a new talking cure. Basically, it does let her talk about her symptoms. The more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories, the more her symptoms were reduced. It was a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever. From then on, Freud encouraged his patients to talk freely about whatever came to mind, to free associate. This technique provided the basis for his career and an entire branch of psychology. In 1900, he published his book The Interpretation of Dreams, where he introduced his theory of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment, the whole patient on the couch scenario, and that's definitely part of it. But Freud's concept was actually a lot more complex than that, and it was revolutionary. The radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the theory that our personalities are shaped by unconscious motives. Basically, Freud suggested that we're all profoundly affected by mental processes that we're not even aware of. Now that sounds almost obvious to us now, but part of the genius of Freud's theory was that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The idea that our minds could be driven by something that our minds themselves didn't know about was hard to grasp, as hard as like, maybe organisms evolving by natural selection. It was abstract, invisible, and there was something about it that seemed irrational. The other important part of Freud's theory was that the subconscious, literally the thing below consciousness, was still discoverable. Even though you weren't aware of it, you could come to understand it through a therapeutic technique that used dreams, projections, and free association to root out repressed feelings and gain self insight. So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery, and this was a really big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and at best, given many labor to do, and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. After the interpretation of dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and countless papers with an iconic cigar and hand all the while. He believed smoking helped him think, but it also helped him get jaw cancer. During the last 16 years of his life, he underwent at least 30 painful operations, while continuing to smoke. By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over Austria and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly escaped to England. By September 1939, the pain in his cancerous jaw was too great, and a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through morphine injection. He was 83. Whether you love him or hate him and make no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed with him. There is no question that Freud's impact on psychology was monumental. While competing theories in the young field of psychology either fell away or evolved into something else, psychoanalysis remains an important concept and practiced today. The next big shake-up rolled in during the first half of the 20th century when behaviorism gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B.F. Skinner were key players here. They focused on the study of observable behavior. You may remember Skinner, as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published his behavior of organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism, and remained all the rage well in the 1960s. The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many descendants collectively known as the psychodynamic theories. These focused on the importance of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness and how that process affects our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and personalities. By the mid-20th century, other major forces in psychology were also brewing schools will explore later in this course, including humanist psychology, who are on nurturing personal growth, cognitive science, and neuroscience, all of which contributed their own unique takes on the study of mind. Today's formal definition of psychology, the study of behavior and mental processes, is a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. It recognizes the need for observing and recording behavior, whether that's screaming, crying, or playing air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but it also gives credit to our mental processes, what we think and feel, and believe while we're tearing it up on our invisible instruments. Because again, the point that I really want you to take home is that psychology is an integrative science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree plenty, but the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions, and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. The human mind is complicated, there is no single way to effectively crack it open, it must be prideth from all sides. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingrich has gazed into the distant horizons of space, and even he has acknowledged that the world is in a very different way than the world. And even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get to have one of our very own! Lock it around right up in here! We here at Crash Course are really excited to spend the next several months delving into the world of psychology, how it applies to our lives, our minds, and our hearts, and how it deepens our understanding of each other, our world, and ourselves.

The results of psychological research are relevant to problems such as learning and memory, homelessness, psychological disorders, family instability, and aggressive behavior and violence. Psychological research is used in a range of important areas, from public policy to driver safety. It guides court rulings with respect to racism and sexism (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954; Fiske, Bersoff, Borgida, Deaux, & Heilman, 1991), as well as court procedure in the use of lie detectors during criminal trials, for example (Saxe, Dougherty, & Cross, 1985). Psychological research helps us understand how driver behavior affects safety (Fajen & Warren, 2003), which methods of educating children are most effective (Alexander & Winne, 2006; Woolfolk-Hoy, 2005), how to detect deception best (DePaulo et al., 2003), and the causes of terrorism (Borum, 2004). Some psychological research is basic research, which answers fundamental questions about behavior. For instance, biopsychologists study how nerves conduct impulses from the receptors in the skin to the brain, and cognitive psychologists investigate how different types of studying influence memory for pictures and words. There is no particular reason to examine such things except to acquire a better knowledge of how these processes occur. What is Applied Research? Applied research is research that investigates issues that have implications for everyday life and provides solutions to everyday problems. Applied research has been conducted to study, among many other things, the most effective methods for reducing depression, the types of advertising campaigns that serve to reduce drug and alcohol abuse, the key predictors of managerial success in business, and the indicators of effective government programs, such as Head Start.

In addition to helping you learn the material in this course, the ability to interpret and conduct research is also useful in many of the careers that you might choose. For instance, advertising and marketing researchers study how to make advertising more effective, health and medical researchers study the impact of behaviors such as drug use and smoking on illness, and computer scientists study how people interact with computers. Furthermore, even if you are not planning a career as a researcher, jobs in almost any area of social, medical, or mental health science require that a worker be informed about psychological research.

Does coffee make you smarter? Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster? Like, bunch of psychology itself, questions like these can seem pretty intuitive. I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right? So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people, and what makes them tick. But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition. If you have some idea about a person in their behavior that turns it to be right, that reinforces your trust in your intuition. Like, if I worn my buddy Bob against eating that deep dish pizza that's been in the fridge for the past week, but he eats it anyway, and soon starts to wig out, I'm gonna say, dude, I told you so. But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again. This is known as hindsight bias, or the, I knew it all along, phenomenon. This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong. It just means that our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened than what will happen in the future. Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward overconfidence. Sometimes you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're really, really wrong. We've all been there. We also tend to perceive order and random events, which can lead to false assumptions. For example, if you flip a coin five times, you have equal chances of getting all tails as you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that result some kind of meeting that it very definitely does not have. That is why we have the methods in safeguards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds. So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart. Sorry. In most ways, psychological research is no different than in the other scientific discipline. Like, step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and turn them into measurable, testable propositions. This is called operationalizing your questions. So you know how the scientific method works, it starts with a question and a theory. And I don't mean theory in the sense of like a hunch that, say, a quad shot of espresso makes you think better. Instead, in science, a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes. And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis. Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report them with. So, for example, defining exactly what you mean by thinking better with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. And replication is key. You can want to person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much. But if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're probably on to something. This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research. Case studies, which take an in-depth look at one individual. Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of overgeneralizing. Still, they're good at showing us what can happen and end up framing questions for more extensive and generalizable studies. They're also often memorable in a great storytelling device psychologist used to observe and describe behavior. Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable. That obviously doesn't mean that it has that same effect on everyone. In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually quite rare. Poor Carl. But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment, whether that's chimps poking ant hills in the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games. The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control the situation. So yeah, basically just spying on people. Like, case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're very limited in explaining it. The content is can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews asking people to report their opinions and behaviors. Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings and a pair of revolutionary texts, sexual behavior in the human male and female respectively. Surveys are a great way to access people's consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask the questions can be tricky. Settle word choices can influence results. For example, more forceful words like ban or censor maleist at different reactions than limit or not allow. Asking, do you believe in space aliens is a much different question than do you think that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe? It's the same question, but in the first, the subject might assume that you mean aliens visiting earth and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them. And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. I could ask a roomful of students at a pacifist club meaning what they think about arms control, but the results wouldn't be a representative measure of where students stand because there's a pretty clear sampling bias that we're here. To fairly represent a population, I'd need to get a random sample where all members of the target group, in this case, students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question. So, once you've described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it and even predict future behavior. One way to do that is to look at how one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. So, let's get back to my buddy Bob, who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. Let's say the Bob is just tucked into a lunch of questionable leftovers. Pizza that may very well have had a little bit of fungus on it, but he was hungry and lazy. And so he doused it in Siracha. Suddenly, he starts seeing things. Green armadillos with laser-by-eyes. From here, we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination. That's a correlation, but correlation is not causation. Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's possible that Bob was already on the verge of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers were actually benign. Or there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72 hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations, but it's super important to remember that correlations predict the possibility of cause and effect relationships. They cannot prove them. So we've talked about how to describe behavior without manipulating it, and how to make connections and predictions from those findings, but that can only take you so far. To really get to the bottom of cause and effect behaviors, you're gonna have to start experimenting. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. This means that they need at least two groups, the experimental group, which is gonna get messed with, and the control group, which is not gonna get messed with. Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants to each group to minimize potential confounding variables or outside factors that may skew the results. You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one group and all wealthy Japanese surfers in the other. They got a mingle. Now, sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what's actually being tested. For example, researchers can test how substances affect people by comparing their effects to placebos, or inert substances. And often, the researchers themselves don't know which group is experimental and which is control, so they don't unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior. In which case, it's called, you guessed it, a double blind procedure. So let's put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. Like all good work, it starts with a question. So the other day, my friend Bernice and I were debating. We're debating caffeine's effect on the brain. Personally, she's convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all jittery like a caged mere cat and can't focus on anything. And because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, we decided to do some critical thinking. So let's figure out our question. The humans solve problems faster when given caffeine. Now we gotta boil that down into a testable prediction. Remember, keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated. Caffeine makes me smarter is not a great hypothesis. A better one would be say, adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine. The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. So you'll leave some coffee, your result, or dependent variable, the thing that depends on the thing that you can change is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates this giant corn maze. Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of different kinds of people and randomly assign them into three different groups. Also, at this point, the American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone's informed consent to participate. You don't want the force anyone to be in your experiment, no matter how cool you think it is. So the control group gets a placebo, in this case, decaf, experimental group one gets a low dose of caffeine, which will define it 100 milligrams, just an eye opener, and like a cup of coffee's worth, experimental group two gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in a red bowl. Once you dose everyone, turn them loose in the maze, and wait at the other end with a stopwatch. All it's left is to measure your results from the three different groups and compare them to see if there were any conclusive results. If the highly-dose folks got through it twice as fast as the low dose, placebo groups, then Bernice's hypothesis was correct, and she could rub my face in it, saying she was right all along, but really, that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias, telling her something she didn't really know until we tested it. Then, because we've used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds can easily replicate this experiment, and we can eventually pool all the data together, and have something solid to say about what that macchiata was doing to your cognition, or at least the speed it which she can run through a maze. Science. Probably the best tool that you have for understanding other people. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Psychology.

Publications The Power of Empathy in Innovation Implementing Design Thinking for Corporate Teams\n\n--- Understanding Design Thinking ---\nWhat is Design Thinking? Design thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation. It involves understanding the needs of people, re-framing problems, and generating creative solutions. Unlike traditional problem-solving methods, design thinking encourages a deep empathy for users and a willingness to experiment with new ideas. The six key stages of design thinking are: Empathise: Understand the people you're designing for. Define: Clearly articulate the problem. Ideate: Generate a wide array of possible solutions. Prototype: Build a tangible representation of one or more ideas. Test: Test the prototypes with users and refine them based on feedback. Implement: Roll out the refined solution to the market or integrate it into the operational workflow. Watch: The Design Thinking Process Estimated Video Length: 4 minutes Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n--- Empathy: The Cornerstone of Design Thinking ---\nEmpathise with Users and Define Problems from Their Perspective Understanding your users is the cornerstone of design thinking. To truly empathise, start by immersing yourself in their environment. Conduct interviews, observe their interactions, and engage in their daily activities. Use techniques like empathy maps and user journey maps to organise and visualise the insights you gather. For example, if you're designing a new feature for a mobile app, spend time observing how users interact with similar apps. Ask open-ended questions to uncover their pain points and needs. By defining problems from their perspective, you shift from making assumptions to addressing real user concerns. This user-centric approach ensures that the solutions you develop are relevant and impactful. Building Your Empathy Toolkit: Interviews: Engage with users by asking open-ended questions to get deeper insights. Observation: Spend time watching users as they interact with products or services in their natural environment. Shadowing: Follow users to gain first-hand experience of their day-to-day interactions and challenges. Empathy ensures that the solutions you create are rooted in a genuine understanding of your users' needs and will lead to more innovative and impactful outcomes. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n--- Ideation Techniques for Generating Creative Solutions ---\nThe Ideation Process: From Insight to Innovation Once you’ve developed a deep understanding of the user’s needs, the next step is to generate a range of creative solutions. Ideation is about thinking broadly and without judgment to explore all possibilities. The goal is to foster creativity and unlock new ideas that might not have been obvious at the start. Brainstorming for Innovation: Brainstorming is one of the most common ideation techniques. It encourages a free flow of ideas within a diverse group. The key to a successful brainstorming session is creating a safe space where participants can share their ideas without fear of criticism. This is important for nurturing wild ideas that can lead to groundbreaking innovations. Other Effective Ideation Techniques: SCAMPER: This method encourages you to think about an existing idea and how it can be modified using the acronym SCAMPER: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. This structured approach helps you explore different perspectives. Mind Mapping: A visual tool that starts with a central idea and branches out into various sub-ideas, enabling you to explore the relationships between concepts and discover hidden connections. Crazy 8s: A rapid sketching technique where participants draw eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. This fast-paced exercise pushes creative boundaries and challenges conventional thinking. From Ideas to Prototypes After gathering a wealth of ideas, it's time to narrow them down to the most promising solutions. Prioritize ideas based on feasibility, impact, and user needs. For instance, if you're redesigning a website, use these techniques to come up with innovative features or enhancements that could improve user experience. By employing a variety of ideation methods, you’ll ensure a wide range of potential solutions. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n--- Prototyping and Testing Ideas ---\nTurning Ideas into Actionable Prototypes Prototyping transforms abstract ideas into tangible solutions that can be tested and refined. This stage is where creativity meets practicality as you begin to build a representation of your solution. Prototypes can be low-fidelity (simple sketches) or high-fidelity (interactive digital models), depending on the stage of development. Types of Prototypes: Low-Fidelity Prototypes: These are quick, low-cost representations of your idea, such as hand-drawn sketches or paper models. They allow you to test ideas without investing significant time or resources. For example, you might sketch a new workflow for project management on a whiteboard to see how users respond to it. High-Fidelity Prototypes: These are more polished and interactive models created using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. They simulate the user experience more closely and are useful when you need detailed feedback on specific interactions. How to effectively prototype and test your ideas: Create Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Start with simple sketches or wireframes. These are quick and inexpensive ways to visualise concepts and gather initial feedback. Build Interactive Models: Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to create clickable prototypes that simulate user interactions. Conduct Usability Testing: Present your prototypes to real users and observe their interactions. Gather feedback on what works well and what needs improvement. For example, if you’re designing a new user interface, build a clickable prototype and test it with a small group of users. Their feedback will guide you in refining the design before investing in a more polished version. Testing with Real Users Prototypes are only as good as the feedback they generate. Once you’ve built a prototype, test it with real users to see how they interact with it. Pay close attention to areas where users encounter difficulties or confusion. Usability testing can reveal invaluable insights that will guide you in refining your solution. Testing should be an iterative process where you repeatedly refine the prototype based on feedback until the design meets user needs effectively. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n",

Psychologists deal with important problems about how the human mind works and why. The following video clip explains just one fascinating phenomenon called the McGurk Effect. Video: Try This Bizarre Illusion Did you find yourself hearing the wrong sound when the picture changed? I must confess, I found myself drawn into the illusion! While it may appear trivial at first glance, this phenomenon sheds light on the remarkable intricacies of our minds, merely scratching the surface of their complexity. It's precisely these captivating puzzles that drive psychologists to delve deeper into understanding human cognition and behavior. Throughout this introductory course in psychology, we'll embark on a journey to explore various concepts and theories. As we progress through objectives and activities, I encourage you to draw connections between your own life experiences—things you've observed, heard, or directly encountered—and the research, findings, and theories we'll be exploring together. Select 'Next' to continue ⬇︎\n\n--- 1.2 - Introduction to Psychology Overview ---\nWhat is Psychology? Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. The word “psychology” comes from the Greek words “psyche,” meaning life, and “logos,” meaning explanation. Psychology is a popular major for students, a popular topic in the public media, and a part of our everyday lives. Television shows such as Dr. Phil feature psychologists who provide personal advice to those with personal or family difficulties. Crime dramas such as CSI, Lie to Me, and others feature the work of forensic psychologists who use psychological principles to help solve crimes. And many people have direct knowledge about psychology because they have visited psychologists, for instance, school counselors, family therapists, and religious, marriage, or bereavement counselors. Because we are frequently exposed to the work of psychologists in our everyday lives, we all have an idea about what psychology is and what psychologists do. In many ways I am sure that your conceptions are correct. Psychologists do work in forensic fields, and they do provide counseling and therapy for people in distress. But there are hundreds of thousands of psychologists in the world, and most of them work in other places, doing work that you are probably not aware of. What Next? This lesson provides an introduction to the broad field of psychology and the many approaches that psychologists take to understanding human behavior. We will consider how psychologists conduct scientific research, with an overview of some of the most important approaches used and topics studied by psychologists, and also consider the variety of fields in which psychologists work and the careers that are available to people with psychology degrees.

The results of psychological research are relevant to problems such as learning and memory, homelessness, psychological disorders, family instability, and aggressive behavior and violence. Psychological research is used in a range of important areas, from public policy to driver safety. It guides court rulings with respect to racism and sexism (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954; Fiske, Bersoff, Borgida, Deaux, & Heilman, 1991), as well as court procedure in the use of lie detectors during criminal trials, for example (Saxe, Dougherty, & Cross, 1985). Psychological research helps us understand how driver behavior affects safety (Fajen & Warren, 2003), which methods of educating children are most effective (Alexander & Winne, 2006; Woolfolk-Hoy, 2005), how to detect deception best (DePaulo et al., 2003), and the causes of terrorism (Borum, 2004). Some psychological research is basic research, which answers fundamental questions about behavior. For instance, biopsychologists study how nerves conduct impulses from the receptors in the skin to the brain, and cognitive psychologists investigate how different types of studying influence memory for pictures and words. There is no particular reason to examine such things except to acquire a better knowledge of how these processes occur. What is Applied Research? Applied research is research that investigates issues that have implications for everyday life and provides solutions to everyday problems. Applied research has been conducted to study, among many other things, the most effective methods for reducing depression, the types of advertising campaigns that serve to reduce drug and alcohol abuse, the key predictors of managerial success in business, and the indicators of effective government programs, such as Head Start.

To really understand psychology, you must also understand how and why the research you are reading about was conducted and what the collected data mean. Learning about the principles and practices of psychological research will allow you to critically read, interpret, and evaluate research. In addition to helping you learn the material in this course, the ability to interpret and conduct research is also useful in many of the careers that you might choose. For instance, advertising and marketing researchers study how to make advertising more effective, health and medical researchers study the impact of behaviors such as drug use and smoking on illness, and computer scientists study how people interact with computers. Furthermore, even if you are not planning a career as a researcher, jobs in almost any area of social, medical, or mental health science require that a worker be informed about psychological research.

Publications The Power of Empathy in Innovation Implementing Design Thinking for Corporate Teams\n\n--- Understanding Design Thinking ---\nWhat is Design Thinking? Design thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation. It involves understanding the needs of people, re-framing problems, and generating creative solutions. Unlike traditional problem-solving methods, design thinking encourages a deep empathy for users and a willingness to experiment with new ideas. The six key stages of design thinking are: Empathise: Understand the people you're designing for. Define: Clearly articulate the problem. Ideate: Generate a wide array of possible solutions. Prototype: Build a tangible representation of one or more ideas. Test: Test the prototypes with users and refine them based on feedback. Implement: Roll out the refined solution to the market or integrate it into the operational workflow. Watch: The Design Thinking Process Estimated Video Length: 4 minutes Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n--- Empathy: The Cornerstone of Design Thinking ---\nEmpathise with Users and Define Problems from Their Perspective Understanding your users is the cornerstone of design thinking. To truly empathise, start by immersing yourself in their environment. Conduct interviews, observe their interactions, and engage in their daily activities. Use techniques like empathy maps and user journey maps to organise and visualise the insights you gather. For example, if you're designing a new feature for a mobile app, spend time observing how users interact with similar apps. Ask open-ended questions to uncover their pain points and needs. By defining problems from their perspective, you shift from making assumptions to addressing real user concerns. This user-centric approach ensures that the solutions you develop are relevant and impactful. Building Your Empathy Toolkit: Interviews: Engage with users by asking open-ended questions to get deeper insights. Observation: Spend time watching users as they interact with products or services in their natural environment. Shadowing: Follow users to gain first-hand experience of their day-to-day interactions and challenges. Empathy ensures that the solutions you create are rooted in a genuine understanding of your users' needs and will lead to more innovative and impactful outcomes. Select Next to Continue ⬇︎\n\n",
